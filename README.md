The world in Scarcity is procedural landmass which is then divded into provinces. 

Provinces produce goods, have population, and may be used to construct units. 

# Trade 

Goods come into provinces, and goods come out of provinces. How much, and where goods move is based on the "Trade Vector". Each province  points into a direction based on its location.  

Furthermore, there are 2 major points. A source of trade power, and a sink of trade power. Provinces generally want to move goods away from a source and towards a sink.
